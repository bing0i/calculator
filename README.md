# Calculator
This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator)
and is also my final project of [WebDev101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101) course. 
This calculator can handle basic operation with add, subtract, multiply and divide operators. 
If I am not busy, I will add keyboard support for it.
